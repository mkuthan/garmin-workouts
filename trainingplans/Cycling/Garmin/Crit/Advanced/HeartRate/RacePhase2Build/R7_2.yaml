  This is a really tough workout that you can use to improve your threshold, as well\
  \ as your ability to repeat hard efforts at the end of the ride or race. Try to\
  \ hold an effort that allows you to complete all 10 reps within each set without\
  \ dropping off. \nIf you haven't done this workout before, start at the low end\
  \ of zone 5 and go from there."
