Command line tools for managing Garmin Connect workouts.

Features:

* Target power is set according to Your current FTP.
* All workouts under Your control stored as JSON files.
* Easy to understand workout format, see examples below.
* Workout parts like warm-up or cool-down are reusable.
* Schedule saved workouts
* The most important parameters (TSS, IF, NP) embedded in workout description field.

# Installation

Requirements:

* Python 3.x ([doc](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

Clone this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mkuthan/garmin-workouts.git
```

Use the venv command to create a virtual copy of the entire Python installation.:

```shell
cd garmin-workouts
python3 -m venv venv
```

Set your shell to use the venv paths for Python by activating the virtual environment:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

First call to Garmin Connect takes some time to authenticate user.
Once user is authenticated [cookie jar](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookiejar.html) is created with session
cookies for further calls.
It is required due to strict request limits for Garmin [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) service.

## Authentication

Define Garmin connect account credentials as `GARMIN_USERNAME` and `GARMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables:

```shell
export GARMIN_USERNAME=username
export GARMIN_PASSWORD=password
```

Alternatively use `-u` and `-p` command line arguments:

```shell
python -m garminworkouts -u [USERNAME] -p [PASSWORD]
```

## Import Workouts

Import workouts into Garmin Connect from definitions in [YAML](https://yaml.org) files.
If the workout already exists it will be updated:

```shell
python -m garminworkouts import --ftp [YOUR_FTP] 'sample_workouts/*.yaml'
```

Sample workout definition:

```yaml
name: "Boring as hell but simple workout"

steps:
  - { power: 50, duration: "10:00" }
  - { power: 70, duration: "20:00" }
  - { duration: "5:00" }
  - { power: 70, duration: "20:00" }
  - { power: 50 }
```

* Target power is defined as percent of FTP (provided as mandatory command line parameter).
  If the target power is not specified "No target" will be used for the workout step.
* Target power may be defined as absolute value like: "150W", it could be useful in FTP ramp tests.
* Duration is defined as HH:MM:SS (or MM:SS, or SS) format.
  If the duration is not specified "Lap Button Press" will be used to move into next workout step.

Reusing workout definitions:

```yaml
name: "Boring as hell but simple workout"

steps:
  - !include inc/warmup.yaml
  - { power: 70, duration: "20:00" }
  - { duration: "5:00" }
  - { power: 70, duration: "20:00" }
  - !include inc/cooldown.yaml
```

* `!include` is a custom YAML directive for including another file as a part of the workout.

Reusing workout steps:

```yaml
name: "Boring as hell but simple workout"

steps:
  - !include inc/warmup.yaml
  - &INTERVAL { power: 70, duration: "20:00" }
  - { duration: "5:00" }
  - *INTERVAL
  - !include inc/cooldown.yaml
```

* Thanks to YAML aliases, workout steps can be easily reused once defined.

Sample Over-Under workout:

```yaml
name: "OverUnder 3x9"

steps:
  - !include inc/warmup.yaml
  - &INTERVAL
    - &UNDER { power: 95, duration: "2:00" }
    - &OVER { power: 105, duration: "1:00" }
    - *UNDER
    - *OVER
    - *UNDER
    - *OVER
    - { power: 50, duration: "3:00" }
  - *INTERVAL
  - *INTERVAL
  - !include inc/cooldown.yaml
```

* All nested sections are mapped as repeated steps in Garmin Connect.
  First repeat for warmup, second repeat for main interval (repeated 3 times) and the last one for cooldown.

To import your workout from an `xlsx` file, construct a table in Excel that looks like this (making sure that all Excel
cells are set to text and not to date or any other format):

| Start | End | Duration |
|-------|-----|----------|
| 43    | 85  | 3:00     |
| 85    |     | 15:00    |
| 85    | 43  | 2:00     |

If your "start" and "end" power for a step differ, a ramp of 10 seconds steps will be created by default for the chosen
duration. If more than 50 total steps are to be uploaded ramp's steps will get longer so that the total number of steps
is under Garmin maximum value of 50. **TIPS** *Do not use your TACX without the power cable as your Garmin will have a
hard time controlling the trainer while changing from one step to the next. Turn off the tones in your Garmin.* If you
wish to give your values in W instead of % of your FTP:

| Start | End  | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| 80W   | 160W | 3:00     |
| 160W  |      | 15:00    |
| 160W  | 80W  | 2:00     |

You can then import as with the `yaml` files:

```shell
python -m garminworkouts import --ftp [YOUR_FTP] my.workout.xlsx
```

This will generate a `yaml` file with the name `my.workout.xlsx`. The name of the workout will be "my.workout".

## Export Workouts

Export all workouts from Garmin Connect into local directory as FIT files.
This is the easiest way to synchronize all workouts with Garmin device:

```shell
python -m garminworkouts export /mnt/GARMIN/NewFiles
```

## List Workouts

Print summary for all workouts (workout identifier, workout name and description):

```shell
$ python -m garminworkouts -u [GARMIN_USERNAME] -p [GARMIN_PASSWORD] list
188952654 VO2MAX 5x4           FTP 214, TSS 80, NP 205, IF 0.96

188952349 OU 3x6               FTP 214, TSS 47, NP 181, IF 0.85
188952348 SS 6x6               FTP 214, TSS 65, NP 178, IF 0.83
127739603 FTP RAMP             FTP 214, TSS 62, NP 230, IF 1.08
```

## Get Workout
